**Song name**
**Author**: The author of the song
**Description**: The description of the song taken from the description META tag
**Content description**: The first 3 lines of the song

##### Program Structure:
###### The program is divided into two main projects:


**The web application** - which is the application the user interacts with and the requests are being sent from. 

**The web server** - where the requests are being handled (by controllers) and where the models are defined.
Under the Controllers folder in this project you will find:
* Admin controller:
	* Getting the document from the link and parsing it
	* Creating the index file and inverted index file
	* Saving the documents and the terms in the database
	* Getting all the documents to the admin
	* Activating and deactivating documents
* Search controller:
	* Query validations
	* Query parsing
	* Combine soundex and stemming
	* Supports binary operators and parentheses in the query
	* Getting the relevant documents from the queryâ€™s words
